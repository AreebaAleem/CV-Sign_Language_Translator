# **Pakistani Sign Language Translator**

## **Project Overview**
Welcome to the **Pakistani Sign Language Translator** project repository. This initiative is a part of our Computer Vision semester coursework, developed with MATLAB. Here, we document our journey and the milestones we achieve in creating a tool that can translate Pakistani Sign Language gestures into text.

## **Mission**
Our mission is to develop a translator that not only recognizes gestures with high accuracy but also provides a seamless translation experience. We aim to empower the deaf community in Pakistan by offering them a means to communicate more effectively with the wider society.

## **Core Features**
- **Gesture Recognition**: Leverages cutting-edge computer vision algorithms to detect and interpret sign language gestures.
- **Real-Time Translation**: Translates gestures into text instantaneously, facilitating real-time communication.

## **Team**
This project is the collective effort of three dedicated group members, each contributing their expertise in Python and computer vision to bring this translator to life.

## **Contributions**
We encourage contributions that can enhance the functionality of the Sign Language Translator. Feel free to fork this repository, propose changes through pull requests, or discuss ideas in issues.

## **Future Scope**
Upon successful completion, we plan to extend the projectâ€™s capabilities to include more languages and dialects, making it a versatile tool for non-verbal communication across different cultures.
